# Stanford Machine Learning Course
Repo containing my complete solutions no the Stanford Machine Learning course.

Solutions are written in GNU Octave.

Course can be found on [Stanford's Website](http://online.stanford.edu/course/machine-learning) and hosted on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

## Exercises
Exercise include:
1. Implement linear regression algorithm.
2. Build logistic regressor.
3. One-vs-all logistic regression for recognising hand-wnitten digits.
4. Implementation of backpropogation algorithm and application to hand-written digit recognition.
5. Study bias-variance dichotomy with regularized linear regressors.
6. Build a spam classifier using SVMs.
7. Use K-means clustering to compress an image and PCA to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.
8. Implement anomaly-detection algorithm to detect failing servers on a network and use collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.
