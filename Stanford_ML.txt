Linear Regression
 - cost function
 - gradient descent

Logistic Regression
 - modified cost function from linear regression
 - apply regularization to stop overfitting the data, this basically implements a cost for high values of theta

Neural Networks
 - non-linear hypotheses
 - back-propogation algorithm
 - gradient checking (numerical) can be helpful to ensure your algorithm is performing as expected

Error
 - precision and recall
 - error metrics for skewed classes
 - learning curves


Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
 - large margin classifier
 - kernels

Unsupervised Learning

Clustering 
 - k-means clustering
 - principal component anlysis (PCA)



Anomaly detection (unsupervised learning)
 - very small number of positive examples, new anomalies won't look like what we've seen before.
 - if data is non-guassian, convert using log, sqrt
 - choose features that might take on unusually large or small values in the event of an anomaly (can be combinations of features)
 - multivariate guassian distribution allows you to fit ellipse and rotated distributions.
 - MGD automatically captures correlations between features (e.g. x3 = x1/x2)
 - comput more expensive


Learning with Large Datasets
- one reason ML is better is because increased size of datasets

Stochastic Gradient Descent
  - allows for scaling of gradient descent for large datasets
 - let's look at single examples instead of as a batch 

Mini-batch gradient 
 - works between batch and stochastic.
 - using a small size of parameters decrease of risk of moving in wrong direction
 - can parralelise

Online Learning
 - continuous stream of data, want to update this as we go
 - update theta with each data point
 - algorithm can adapt to change in consumer preferences (as long as alpha isn't decreasing)
 - allows you to learn probability distribution

Map Reduce
 - can scale even larger than stochastic gradient descent
 - break up training set and perform calculations on different computers finally combining with core
 

Photo OCR 
 - pipeline design
 - ML pipeline
 - flow of information/stages of dissemination
 - sliding window detection
 - expansion operation

Artificial Data Synthesis
 - How much work would it take to get 10x as much data as we currently have?
